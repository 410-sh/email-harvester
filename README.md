# email-harvester

This script reads through email messages in a Gmail Inbox and writes the data into a PDF report. The data read from the mailbox is then written into a PDF document containing the sender email & IP address, the subject, body and IP Geolocation of where the email was sent from.

This was initially created as a project to help investigate phishing attacks by helping to easily track where emails were coming from.

Usage: ./email_harvester.py
